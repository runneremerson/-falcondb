## Compilation

Just run `make` will compile falcondb in release/debug mode and build the test cases in directory test.
We do depend on newer gcc/clang with C++11 support.

tcmalloc is preferred or you can use jemalloc instead by add specific module in build.sh


## Supported platforms
* **Linux - Ubuntu**
    * Upgrade your gcc to version at least 4.7 to get C++11 support.
    * Install gflags. First, try: `sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev`
      If this doesn't work and you're using Ubuntu, here's a nice tutorial:
